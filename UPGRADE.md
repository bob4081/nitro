# Upgrade Notes

## Upgrading to Nitro 0.10.0

As of Nitro 0.10.0, all machine configs must be stored stored at `~/.nitro/<machine-name>.yaml`.

If you are updating from a previous version, you will need to rename your current `~/.nitro/nitro.yaml` file based
on the name of your primary machine name. (If you canâ€™t remember what that is, open up the file and check its `name`
value.)

```sh
cd ~/.nitro
mv nitro.yaml <machine-name>.yaml
```

If your primary machine name was something besides `nitro-dev`, you will need to define a `NITRO_DEFAULT_MACHINE`
environment variable on your system, so Nitro knows which machine to work with by default. For example on macOS or
Unix/Linux systems, you can open your `~/.bash_profile` file (or `.zprofile` if using zsh) and add this to it:

```bash
export NITRO_DEFAULT_MACHINE="<machine-name>"
```

Then paste the same line into your terminal, or restart it for the profile change to take effect.

If you created any additional machines, you will need to move their configuration files over to `~/.nitro` as well:

```sh
mv /path/to/project/nitro.yaml ~/.nitro/<machine-name>.yaml
```
